## Connecting to mongodb with node.js
Mongoose is an object document mapper or ODM.
Provides functionality: Schema validation on top pf the MongoDB node.js driver.

## Node.js concurrency and event loop fundamentals
You interact with MongoDB Node JS driver using callbacks.
These callbacks hints at Javascript's concurrency model.
Javascript is a language build to run in a event loop.
First of all, the loop is single threaded.
Therefore, instead of thinking of Javascript as an imperative programming language like Java or C++.

## require() basics
The require function in Node.js mechanism for breaking up large projects into small, manageable files.
The require functions lets you include functions from external modules and other files.

Node.js uses file level scoping. This means that by default, any variable or function declared in a file is not accessible outside of that file.

Node.js has a global object, but using it is almost always a mistake.
The require function is the preferred way to shar code between files.
