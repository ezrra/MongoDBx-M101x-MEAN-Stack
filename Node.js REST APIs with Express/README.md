## What is a REST API

At a high level, a REST API is an interface for client-side Javascript running. To read data from and store data to your server.
REST, which stands for Representational State Tranfer, is a paradigm for a browser to communicate with a server over HTTP, which is short for Hypertext Tranfer Protocol.


## Introduction to Express

Express provides routing and other high-level abstractions that are indispensable for modern web development.

## API-level TDD

Superagent module is a popular node.js HTTP client. You can use superagent to make HTTP requests.
Mocha supports asynchonous test.

## Dependency injection in NodeJs + ExpressJs
Is a software engineering practice that helps you break your code up into small, easy to maintain, chunks. The general idea of DI is to separate initialization code from business logic, so your rest API route handlers never have to worry about say, setting up Mongoose models.

Wagner has a rich feature set that goes well beyond dependency injection but for the purposes of this course you'll be using Wagner as a dependency injector. Wagner lets you register named factories which are functions that return values. These values are known as services.
