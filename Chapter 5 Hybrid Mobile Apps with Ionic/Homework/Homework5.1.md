Why is it better to compile the templates for your AngularJS directives in your Ionic app rather than fetching them over HTTP?

- Because Ionic can't fetch templates over HTTP

- Because of CORS restrictions

X So the templates are downloaded when the app is downloaded from the app store

- So Ionic can serve the templates from a web server running on your phone

- So you don't have to download the templates until the app is run
